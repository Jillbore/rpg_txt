Skills based on stats
	Number of skills based on level	
		Or maybe tiers based on current level?
	+5 stats per level (plus class bonus?)
	+1 skill per level, bonus every 5th? (Maybe a passive?)

Skill damage based on stats, spell damage based on cast power?
	Cast failure based on stats?

Interactive environment (maybe affect elemental damage?)

Item shops? Magic items? Crafting?

Combat system???

Character moves based on speed points
	Fast characters regen faster	
		Higher base for some?


Experience divided based on speed points spent? (arguably prevents power-leveling)
	More or less equal to "how hard you tried"
